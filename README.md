Utilities for working with week days and weekend days in Moment. It assumes a Western
workweek, in which weekends are Saturday and Sunday.

### Motivation

[Moment](http://momentjs.com/) is an indispensable tool for working with dates in Javascript, but it
doesn't supply methods for working with week days or weekend days (at least,
[not yet](https://github.com/moment/moment/issues/1947)).

This library supplies you with those missing tools.

### Why this library?

There are alternative libraries for these methods, but this one uses constant-time algorithms, not loops.
Loops are easier for a human to write, but are much slower for a computer to resolve.

### API

##### `weekDays( otherMoment )`

Calculate the number of week days between the moment and `otherMoment`. Week days are Monday through Friday.

##### `weekendDays( otherMoment )`

Calculate the number of weekend days between the moment and `otherMoment`. Weekend days are Saturday and Sunday.

##### `addWeekDays( amount )`

Add week days to a moment, modifying the original moment. Returns the moment.

##### `subtractWeekDays( amount )`

Subtract week days from the moment, modifying the original moment. Returns the moment.

##### `isWeekDay()`

Whether or not the Moment is a week day (Monday - Friday).

##### `isWeekendDay()`

Whether or not the Moment occurs on Saturday or Sunday.
